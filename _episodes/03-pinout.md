There are 40 GPIO pins. A great resource for exploring the pins is the [PinoutComprehensive Guide to the Raspberry Pi](https://pinout.xyz/).

The pins have two numbering schemes. The BOARD numbering scheme refers to the physical location on the board. The BCM scheme refers to the underlying software representation.

> ## Recommendation:
>
> When referring to connections of physical pins, use the BOARD specification. When calling out pins in software, use the BCM scheme.
